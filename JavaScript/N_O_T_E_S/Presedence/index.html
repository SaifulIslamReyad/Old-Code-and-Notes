<!-- 
Inline Styles: Styles defined directly on an HTML element using the style attribute or modified via JavaScript (element.style.property = value) have the highest precedence. These styles apply directly to the element and override all other styles.

ID Selectors: Styles applied using ID selectors (e.g., #myElement) have a higher specificity compared to class selectors and element selectors.

Class Selectors: Styles applied using class selectors (e.g., .myClass) apply to elements with matching classes and have higher specificity than element selectors.

Element Selectors: Styles applied using element selectors (e.g., body, p) have the lowest specificity. These styles apply to all elements of the specified type and are overridden by ID selectors and class selectors.

!important: Adding !important to a style declaration (e.g., color: blue !important;) gives it the highest possible specificity, overriding all other styles except another style with !important.

Order of Appearance: When styles have equal specificity, the last style defined takes precedence. This applies to both external stylesheets and <style> blocks in the <head>, as well as inline styles defined later in the HTML. -->
